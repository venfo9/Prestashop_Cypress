This project demonstrates POM and Auth tests for the PrestaShop site using the Cypress framework. 
Locators and actions are placed in separate classes corresponding to the names of the site pages. 
Email and password are stored in fixtures directory. 
Additionally, there is an error handler class that ignores some errors related to JS elements on the site because, without it, the tests fail
